<h2> About Page </h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    Thorin Oakenshield
    </h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3> Fili and Kili </h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes so they were often sent scouting or searching. They found the Goblins' cave in the Misty Mountains.With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.

    Óin
    </h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3> Glóin </h3>
        <p>
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. After the battle, he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

        <h3>
    Balin
    </h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug.

    Nori

        <p>
            Nori was the brother of Dori and Ori. Both Nori and Dori were capable flutists, and seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both these apparent brothers also shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.n TA 2941, Nori and his two brothers became part of Thorin and Company befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize that Bilbo had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued Bilbo.

        <h3> Bifur </h3>
        <p>
            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

    Bofur
    </h3>
        <p>
            Bofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Rhudaur, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen

        <h3> Bombur </h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

        <h3>
    Gandalf
    </h3>
        <p>
            Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - "Elf of the Wand" or "Wand-elf") the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - "Dreamer" or "Of Dreams"), was an Istar (Wizard), sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
